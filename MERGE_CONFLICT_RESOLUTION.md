# Merge Conflict Resolution

This document outlines how to resolve the merge conflicts in this repository.

## Issue Identified

PR #2 ("My first file") shows `mergeable: false` and `mergeable_state: dirty` indicating merge conflicts between `my-first-branch` and `main` branches.

## Root Cause

The merge conflicts were caused by "unrelated histories" - the `main` and `my-first-branch` branches don't share a common Git history, which is common in GitHub Skills tutorial repositories where different steps create separate commit histories.

## Resolution Steps

To resolve these merge conflicts:

1. **Identify the conflict source**: 
   ```bash
   git merge my-first-branch
   # Results in: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
   ```

2. **Allow unrelated histories merge**:
   ```bash
   git merge my-first-branch --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

3. **Complete the merge**: The merge will succeed as there are no actual content conflicts, just unrelated histories.

## Files Affected

The merge successfully adds:
- `PROFILE.md` file from `my-first-branch` to `main`

No content conflicts exist - the issue was purely the unrelated histories.

## Resolution Status

âœ… Merge conflicts identified and analyzed
âœ… Solution implemented locally 
ðŸ”„ Waiting for main branch update to resolve PR #2

The merge conflicts have been resolved by allowing unrelated histories. Once this is applied to the main branch, PR #2 should become mergeable.
